General code style
-----------------------

Rules to be followed to write quality code:

 * Using 4 spaces instead of tabs.
 * Leaving empty space between tag and content.
 * Each file should end with an empty line 
 * The empty lines shouldn't contain spaces.
 * Just comment everything that's nontrivial.
